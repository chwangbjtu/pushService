    Returns True if a matching file exists, False otherwise
    Parameters:
        document_or_id (optional): query document, or _id of the document to check for
        **kwargs (optional): keyword arguments are used as a query document, if theyâ€™re present.
    The file to check for can be specified by the value of its _id key, or by passing in a query document. A query document can be passed in as dictionary, or by using keyword arguments. Thus, the following three calls are equivalent:
    Examples:
        fs.exists({"foo": {"$gt": 12}}) or fs.exists(foo={"$gt": 12})
        fs.exists({"filename": "mike.txt"}) or fs.exists(filename="mike.txt")

    Returns a cursor that iterates across files matching arbitrary queries on the files collection
    Parameters:
        filter (optional): a SON object specifying elements which must be present for a document to be included in the result set
        skip (optional): the number of files to omit (from the start of the result set) when returning the results
        limit (optional): the maximum number of results to return
        no_cursor_timeout (optional): if False (the default), any returned cursor is closed by the server after 10 minutes of inactivity. If set to True, the returned cursor will never time out on the server. Care should be taken to ensure that cursors with no_cursor_timeout turned on are properly closed.
        sort (optional): a list of (key, direction) pairs specifying the sort order for this query. See sort() for details.
